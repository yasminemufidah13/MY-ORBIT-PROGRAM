Once upon a time, there was a little 	 girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl 	 wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.
One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.
